Devskiller code of unimplemented task

## Task description

This is code for a part of the app which fetches list of recruiters and displays them as a list.

Your task is to:
* Implement fetching of the `Recruiter` list inside `RecruitersBloc` so that this `BLoC` will use implemented `Repository` and handle error and loading states,
* Use implemented BLoC in the `RecruitersScreen` and handle all possible states, you can display a simple `Text` Widget for any possible states,
* Add tests to the `RecruitersRepositoryLocal` class that is already implemented.

You are free to use any libraries and packages, implementation of the `Service` layer is not important here, you can use and mock provided interfaces.

## Upload instructions
